# FutuReddit

Redirects old Reddit to modern Reddit interface.

## Features

- Automatically redirects `old.reddit.com` to `www.reddit.com`
- Maintains current page and parameters
- Works immediately after installation

## How It Works

Detects `old.reddit.com` URLs and redirects to equivalent modern Reddit pages:

```
old.reddit.com/r/programming → www.reddit.com/r/programming
old.reddit.com/user/username → www.reddit.com/user/username
```

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, etc.)
2. Install FutuReddit
3. Visit old Reddit links to see automatic redirection
